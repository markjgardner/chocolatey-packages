    <description>
Terraform is a tool for building, changing, and versioning infrastructure safely and efficiently. Terraform can manage existing and popular service providers as well as custom in-house solutions.

The key features of Terraform are:

* **Infrastructure as Code**: Infrastructure is described using a high-level configuration syntax. This allows a blueprint of your datacenter to be versioned and treated as you would any other code. Additionally, infrastructure can be shared and re-used.
* **Execution Plans**: Terraform has a "planning" step where it generates an *execution plan*. The execution plan shows what Terraform will do when you call apply. This lets you avoid any surprises when Terraform manipulates infrastructure.
* **Resource Graph**: Terraform builds a graph of all your resources, and parallelizes the creation and modification of any non-dependent resources. Because of this, Terraform builds infrastructure as efficiently as possible, and operators get insight into dependencies in their infrastructure.
* **Change Automation**: Complex changesets can be applied to your infrastructure with minimal human interaction. With the previously mentioned execution plan and resource graph, you know exactly what Terraform will change and in what order, avoiding many possible human errors.

For more information, see the [introduction section](http://www.terraform.io/intro) of the Terraform website.

    <releaseNotes>
## 0.11.4 (March 15, 2018)

IMPROVEMENTS:

* cli: `terraform state list` now accepts a new argument `-id=...` for filtering resources for display by their remote ids ([#17221](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/17221))
* cli: `terraform destroy` now uses the option `-auto-approve` instead of `-force`, for consistency with `terraform apply`. The old flag is preserved for backward-compatibility, but is now deprecated; it will be retained for at least one major release. ([#17218](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/17218))
* connection/ssh: Add support for host key verification ([#17354](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/17354))
* backend/s3: add support for the cn-northwest-1 region ([#17216](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/17216))
* provisioner/local-exec: Allow setting custom environment variables when running commands ([#13880](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/13880))
* provisioner/habitat: Detect if hab user exists and only create if necessary ([#17195](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/17195))
* provisioner/habitat: Allow custom service name ([#17196](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/17196))
* general: https URLs are now supported in the HTTP_PROXY environment variable for URLs interpreted by Terraform Core. (This will not immediately be true for all Terraform provider plugins, since each must upgrade its own HTTP client.) [go1.10:net/http](https://golang.org/doc/go1.10#net/http)

BUG FIXES:

* core: Make sure state is locked during initial refresh ([#17422](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/17422))
* core: Halt on fatal provisioner errors, rather than retrying until a timeout ([#17359](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/17359))
* core: When handling a forced exit due to multiple interrupts, prevent the process from exiting while the state is being written ([#17323](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/17323))
* core: Fix handling of locals and outputs at destroy time ([#17241](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/17241))
* core: Fix regression in handling of `count` arguments that refer to `count` attributes from other resources ([#17548](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/17548))
* provider/terraform: restore support for the deprecated `environment` argument to the `terraform_remote_state` data source ([#17545](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/17545))
* backend/gcs: Report the correct lock ID for GCS state locks ([#17397](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/17397))

PROVIDER SDK CHANGES (not user-facing):

* helper/schema: Prevent crash on removal of computed field in CustomizeDiff ([#17261](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/17261))
* helper/schema: Allow ResourceDiff.ForceNew on nested fields (avoid crash) ([#17463](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/17463))
* helper/schema: Allow `TypeMap` to have a `*schema.Schema` as its `Elem`, for consistency with `TypeSet` and `TypeList` ([#17097](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/17097))
* helper/validation: Add ValidateRFC3339TimeString function ([#17484](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/17484))
